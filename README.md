## Lambda Functions

Serverless lambda functions are used as the bulk of the architecture for OneBankQR as it is an event-driven compute service that runs code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers.

The code for the lambda functions can be found [here](integration-layer/lambda-functions/).
